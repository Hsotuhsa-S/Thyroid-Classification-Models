Comparative analysis of Thyroid Classification Models

Goal to compare and evaluate three different models, namely Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), to determine the most suitable model for accurate predictions on this thyroid dataset.

# Conclusion : 
 • Random Forest model is the most favorable choice for predictive modeling in this data
 context.
 • Blood test parameter ‘TSH’ is  emerging as a key predictive feature for predicting Thyroid disease.
